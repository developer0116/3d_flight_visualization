# 3D global flight visualization

This's a website application for 3d global flight visualization using React and D3. For better performance, we use canvas instead of svg in D3.

You can visit the website in https://flight-visualization.herokuapp.com.

You can also run the website locally, by doing:  

```sh
npm install
npm start
```
